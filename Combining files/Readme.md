# Task-1
  <img src="https://github.com/BonniCapron/pict/blob/main/2.png" align="right" alt="2" width="300" style="margin-left: 20px;">
  
The user is given two integers — they can be entered from the keyboard or specified as constants directly in the code.
You need to find the sum of all even integers in the range between these two numbers, inclusive.Each number within the range is checked:

<p> 
-if the number is even, it is added to the current sum
</p>

<p> 
-if odd, the program moves to the next number.
</p>

The result is the total sum of all even numbers in the given range.

Determining the type of a number (positive, negative, or zero)
This is a simple program that asks the user for a number and determines whether it is positive, negative, or zero.

  # Task-5
  
  <img src="https://github.com/BonniCapron/pict/blob/main/2.png" align="right" alt="2" width="300" style="margin-left: 20px;">
  
This program iterates through all six-digit numbers from 000000 to 999999 and determines which of them are lucky tickets.
A "lucky" ticket is considered to be one in which the sum of the first three digits is equal to the sum of the last three.
